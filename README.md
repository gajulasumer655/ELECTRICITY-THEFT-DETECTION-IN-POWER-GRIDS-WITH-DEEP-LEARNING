# ELECTRICITY-THEFT-DETECTION-IN-POWER-GRIDS-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING
This project detects electricity theft by analyzing consumption patterns using a hybrid deep learning model (CNN) combined with Random Forest and SVM classifiers. Built with Python and Tkinter, it provides a GUI to preprocess data, train models, visualize results, and predict fraudulent usage with high accuracy.
